  <h2>Ancient Civilization</h2>
        <p>More than six thousand years ago in the land of <u></i><b>Mesopotamia</u></b></i>there developed
            the most remarkable Civilization betwwen the <i>Tigris</i>and the<i>Euphrtes rivers.</i>These rivers begin
            in the mountains of Amenia and flow in a south-eastern direction towards the Persian Golf.
            the soil around these rivers were extremely fertile.

   <p>A number of different tribes occupied the southern parts of the Tigris-Euphrates.These southern parts were 
    known by different names during dbifferent times among which are <i>Sumer,Akkad(or Accad) and Chaldea</i>
    but the name best known to us is<b><i>Babylonia</i></b>.This area was also the location of the 'Garden of Eden' and the people of this region
    were jet <u>black</u>.The black people have the most ancient history of all human beings.The best and the most
    avaialable source of this is Bible and the history of the jews as it is written in Genesis 2:10-"<i>
    And a river went out  of Eden to water the garden;and from thence it was parted and became four heads.</i> 
    Tigris and Euphrates are the fist and second rivers as stated earlier."And the third river is<b>Hiddekel</b>",commentators and scholars
    say Hiddkel is the Tigris river.In Genesis 2:13-"<i>And the name of the second river is <b>Gihon</b></i>":the same river that compasseth the whole
    land of <u>Ethiopia</u>";Because the the Garden of Eden being associated with the Land of Ethiopia we can conclude that 
    the people were black.An eleventh centuary called Rashi said the Gihon river is the Nile river that flows through eastern Africa in Ethiopia and into Egypt.<br>
<i><b>Fun fact:Eve gene is described in reference to mitochondrial gene. Mitochondrial DNA is transported through the maternal line of inheritance, so mitochondrial DNA is 
  also regarded as eve DNA in reference to creation theory.This gene is found in only black women which shows that all other races are mothered by the black 
   race which was the first original race and people of the world</b></i><br>

<h2><b>Sumer and Kush</b></h2>
<p>Before the dispersal of mankind at the "Tower of Babel." this region was not called Babylon. It was only after the confusion of the language and the dispersal 
  of the people, that the name Babel was given to the Tower. This conclusion is reached by way of logic. What was the name of this region and Tower before the confusion of the language and the dispersal? Webster's Dictionary (gazetteer section) says Sumer is the southern division of ancient Babylon.
  Moreover, this same dictionary says on page 849, Sumerian:
  "the pre-Semitic population of the lower Euphrates Valley.
" The "pre-Semitic population" means that the black Sumerians were there first. This point is in harmony with my original position that the people in lower Mesopotamia were eastern Ethiopians.
 These Sumerians or Ethiopians 
and their kindred appear to have settled along tracts from Mesopotamia to India. This area 
now includes: southern Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and northwest India.
12 The first and second allusions to Sumer in the Bible are in Genesis
  10:10, 11:1 under the name Shinar.
  Webster's Dictionary (gazetteer section) hints to this relationship of Shinar and Sumer. There is definitely a blood relationship between the Dravidian tribes of India and the Ethiopian Sumerians.
   The Sumerian civilization preceded the Babylonian. The Sumeri. ans founded cities that existed more than 4,000 years B.C. such as:<i>Eridu, Lagash, Nippur, Kish, and Ur</i>. 
  Archeologists have found skeletons of ancient Dravidian and Nedda types in Ur and Kish. Antiquated Sumerian statuettes resemble the statuettes of the Dravidian civilization, 13</p>

 <h2><b>Origin of the white race</b></h2>
 <p>
  After the destruction of mankind by the flood, Noah and his wife, his three sons and their wives were the only people that were saved. (The sons of Noah were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. From these three sons of Noah was the whole earth populated.) The Ark rested on Mt. Ararat.? Mt.
  Ararat was located in the land of Armenia. The words Armenia and Ararat mean high ground.
  The entire earth at this time was of one speech and one language. Most of the people dwelled in the plain of Shinar; in Hebrew, the Valley of Shinar. Men began to congregate in the territory and to build a tower up to heaven.ยง The Jewish historian, Flavius Josephus, says: "God also commanded them to send colonies abroad for the thorough peo. pling of the earth,
  " but the people did not obey God. Now, when man was in the process of building the tower, God disapproved of its construction because it showed a disbelief in His word. The Divine had promised Noah that He would not destroy the earth by water again. Nimrod, the Ethiopian, was the leader of the conspiracy against God.
  He was a mighty man and a conqueror. He held the people under his dictatorship. When God considered what had been done, He confused men's language and scattered them toward the four directions of the earth.
  The sons of Noah were: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Because the world was populated from these three sons of Noah, it is proper to classify men only according to this classifi

  cation: Shemites, Hamites, and Japhites; and not Caucasoid, Mongoloid, or Negroid. The latter category is a modern anthropological classification that we will deal with more thoroughly later.</p>
